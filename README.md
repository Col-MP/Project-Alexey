# Project-Alexsy
Python based Tetris style game. Done as a collaborative group project for UMGC Capstone class. 

Project Alexsy is a Python-based Tetris-inspired puzzle game designed to provide an engaging and intuitive gaming experience. Developed using the Pygame library, the game challenges players to manipulate falling tetrominoes to clear horizontal lines while tracking their scores in real-time. Key features include smooth controls for moving and rotating pieces, a "ghost" piece for strategic planning, integrated sound effects, and visually appealing custom fonts. The game is cross-platform, running on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Python 3.12+ and Pygame 2.6.1+, and employs a modular design for ease of maintenance and future enhancements. Its development process emphasized collaboration, effective communication, and rigorous testing to ensure stability and reliability. While optimized for desktops, the game offers potential for future improvements, including expanded customization options, mobile compatibility, and standalone executables for simplified setup. Project Alexsy showcases the power of teamwork and advanced programming concepts to deliver a polished, enjoyable gaming experience.
